My name is Laurent Pellegrino. I'm a senior Software Engineer and Micro-entrepreneur running 
[Noticeable][noticeable], a notification center/changelog for product managers, marketers and developers. 
I like working with new technologies, especially in Java and TypeScript. In my spare time I maintain the
[Medical ID][medicalid] Android app and I really appreciate to go jogging.
